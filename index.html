            <h2>About Notorious</h2>
            <p>Notorious is a full-sized recreation of a 15th Century caravel - the first style of ship to leave Europe to explore Africa, Asia, the America's and beyond. First attributed to Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal, and quickly adopted by the Spanish.
            Her specs: 19m length (56ft), 5.5m beam (18ft), 2.1m draft (7ft), 60,000kgs. 
            Constructed entirely from reclaimed timber, mainly unwanted 100+ year old Monterey Cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) rescued from bonfires on farms in Western Victoria. We are very proud that not a single tree was felled to build her.</p>
            <h2>The Man and the Ship</h2>
            <p>An enigmatic 'Renaissance man', a veritible genius and true visionary. This incredible, fully functional sailing ship was researched, designed and handcrafted by Graeme Wylie over the course of 10 years in Bushfield, Victoria, Australia. 
            Wylie spent over two years researching historical Portuguese and Spanish vessels, in the process he taught himself nautical architecture and produced nine workbooks of calculations. Upon completion of her line drawings, Wylie constructed a working 1:16 model caravel which he put through a series of successful sea trails. 
            In February 2001 Wylie laid the keel and so began what was to be a further 9 years of solo construction. Wylie completed the build and readied her for launching. In what is arguable a nailbiting time for any shipbuilder, Wylie sucessfully launched Notorious in February 2010 at Martin's Point, Port Fairy, Victoria.
            Upon completetion of her kitout, Wylie captained Notorious on her maiden voyage, departing Port Fairy at dawn on Feb 9th 2011 with a crew of family and friends. Three beautiful days and nights at sea culminated in Wylie and crew dropping Notorious' anchor in Corio Bay, Geelong, Victoria.</p>
            <h2>At Home on the Sea</h2>
            <p>Since her launch in 2011, Notorious has sailed on average 2000nm per year, traversing various coastlines, ancorages and ports of Australia's east coast, welcoming excited visitors aboard, young and old, (and sometimes giving the ocassional boat a fright out on the open water). Notorious has delighted and awed every person who has seen her, she is truly a unique vessel, she draws attention everywhere she goes.
